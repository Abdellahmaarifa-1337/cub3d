# cub3D - My First RayCaster with miniLibX

## Foreword

Inspired by the legendary Wolfenstein 3D, this project delves into the realm of ray-casting, offering the opportunity to create a dynamic 3D view inside a maze. Embrace the challenge of navigating through the maze and find your way using the principles of ray-casting.

## Goals

This graphic design project aims to enhance your skills in C programming, algorithms, and information research. cub3D serves as a playground to explore the practical applications of mathematics, offering an opportunity to create elegant and efficient algorithms with the help of available online resources.

## Mandatory Part - cub3D

- Files: All your files
- Makefile: all, clean, fclean, re, bonus
- Arguments: a map in format \*.cub
- External Functions: open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit, All functions of the math library (-lm man man 3 math), All functions of the MinilibX
- Libft Authorized: Yes
- Description: Create a realistic 3D graphical representation of a maze using Ray-Casting principles.

### Constraints

- Use the miniLibX library.
- Ensure smooth window management.
- Display different wall textures based on the wall's facing side.
- Set floor and ceiling colors to two different ones.
- Implement user controls for navigation and window closure.
